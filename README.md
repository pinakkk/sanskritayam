# Sanskritayam Programming Language

Sanskritayam is a fun and experimental programming language inspired by Sanskrit, the ancient language of India. This project was created based on a viral meme from last year, where a group of aunties were discussing the idea of making Sanskrit a coding language. As a joke, my friend [Pinakkk](https://github.com/pinakkk) and I thought of turning this idea into reality, and thus, Sanskritayam was born!

Please note that Sanskritayam is not intended for serious production use and comes with no warranty. It's a purely recreational project meant for learning and entertainment purposes.

## Features

- Sanskrit-inspired syntax and keywords
- Basic programming constructs like variables, conditionals, loops, and functions
- Support for common data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, and dictionaries
- File I/O operations
- Exception handling
- Object-oriented programming concepts

## Getting Started
